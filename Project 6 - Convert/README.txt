Purpose
Practice converting an ERD model to a relational model
Further practice using SQL DDL to create tables and constraints
Overview
For this project, you are provided with an ERD of a database for a fictional website. Your job is to convert the ERD into a relational database schema, following the 7-step algorithm we covered in class (although for this project, you will only need 5 of the steps).

Yulp
Our database will concern the fictional restaurant reviews website, Yulp. The database for the Yulp website is modeled below as an ERD:

(yulp.png is available in the repo)

Some of the elements on the ERD should be obvious - e.g., city, state, zip. Others need some explanation. Below is a brief explanation of the elements of the model, along with examples of the data.

reviewer entity
attribute	explanation	example
screen name	reviewer's user name	'iL1ke2EAT'
identity provider	where reviewer's login comes from (who authenticates them)	'Facebook'
views	total # of views for this reviewer's reviews	782
reviews relationship
attribute	explanation	example
views	# of views for a particular restaurant review	37
rating	numerical rating, 0 - 5	4
review date	when the reviewer submitted the review	'2018-08-21'
comments	reviewer's text comments	'Service was very slow.'
business entity
attribute	explanation	example
business type	type(s) of restaurant or food service business this is	'wine bar', 'bakery', etc.
name	business official name	'Main St. Eatery'
ID	a unique identifier for this business (more on this below)	10342
street address		'1033 Main St.'
city		'Omaha'
state		'NE'
zip		'68069'
menu entity
attribute	explanation	example
label	which service this menu is for	'Lunch', 'Happy Hour', etc.
url	website where the menu can be found	'https://mseatery.com/menus/lunch'
chain entity
attribute	explanation	example
name	name of the restaurant chain	'Outback Steakhouse'
city	city of chain's headquarters	'Tampa'
state	2-letter state code for chain's headquarters	'FL'
Note that the business entity has a key attribute 'ID', which is intended to be automatically generated by the database. This is because the only reasonable key otherwise would include the restaurant name and address to ensure a unique identification - which seems like a very long key. Also, I want you to practice working with sequence-generated keys. So, for this attribute I suggest you use a serial  type column.

Instructions
Your deliverable for this project is a SQL script which, when run against the database, will create an appropriate SQL schema for the ERD above. So that we can grade your work efficiently, there are some rules you need to follow concerning naming - the better your schema aligns to our expectations, the quicker we can validate it.

First, anything from the ERD which produces a table or column should retain the name from the ERD; if the name has multiple words in it, separate the words with an underscore. E.g., if we had an attribute named 'hello world', you would create a column named 'hello_world'.

Second, if you make a foreign key column in a table, name it as <othertablename>_<othertablecolumnname>.

Third, if you need a cross reference table connecting two tables (say, 'table1' and 'table2'), name the cross references table as 'table1_table2_xref', where 'table1' sorts alphabetically before 'table2'.

Fourth, use the example data above to guide your choices on what types to use for your tables, but be thoughtful - if you make a varchar(n)  column for something textual, make sure it is large enough to hold reasonable values.

Finally, while it is not required, it is strongly  recommended that you test your resulting tables by inserting some data into them. Be sure to test your primary and foreign key constraints (we will!)

README...
1. Include your name  and the names of all people who helped/collaborated, as per the syllabus.
	Name: Lauren Sherburne
	Collaborators: Sean Keeney, Professor Read
2. Describe the challenges you encountered and how you surmounted them.
	The biggest challenge I encountered during this assignment was ensuring that my syntax and
	formatting were correct. I had to run and rerun my script more times than I originally
	anticipated. Also, figuring out the details of the cross-reference table was a bit of a
	challenge, especially since one of the foreign keys from reviewer (identity provider) was not
	a unique value. I ended up having to make the identity provider and screen name attributes
	a combined foreign key so that even though they are not necessarily unique separately, they
	must form a unique pair.
3. What did you like/dislike about the assignment?
	I liked that this assignment was straightforward and followed directly what we have been
	discussing in class. However, the examples that we talked about in class appeared to be a lot
	simpler than the relationships in the project which made this assignment more tedious. I,
	personally, appreciate when we discuss the more complicated aspects of a subject in class so
	that the homework/projects come from class and not from internet searching.
4. How long did you spend on this assignment?
	Approximately 5-6 hours

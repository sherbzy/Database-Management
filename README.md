# Database-Management
This repository contains the projects from my Database Management course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Fall 2021. The README in each contains the project requirements and other necessary information.

Course Description: 
This course is all about the construction, design, and use of databases with a peek at their inner workings. We will primarily
focus on relational (SQL) databases, although we will briey touch on NoSQL databases and Big Data systems. A brief list of
topics:
  - Entity-Relationship models and database design
  - The relational database model
  - Relational algebra and normalization
  - SQL queries and relational database management
  - Programming applications against SQL databases
  - NoSQL and Big Data


Learning outcomes for the course are as follows:
  1. Construct a data model using the Entity-Relationship model.
  2.  Design a relational database schema implementing a data model, including tables, indexes, and constraints; analyze functional dependencies and normalize a relational database schema.
  3.  Understand and explain basic relational algebra operations and manipulations.
  4.  Construct retrieval and update queries in SQL; apply transaction control for complex updates; tune queries for performance.
  5.  Build applications using a relational database in Python or Java.

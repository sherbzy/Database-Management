Purpose
Practice database design using entity-relationship diagrams (ERD)
Note on the due date...
This is due after Midterm 1 since ERDs are not part of the midterm material. But you may want to get an early start and return to it after you are done with the midterm, rather than try to complete it all on its due date. That way you will have time to ask questions and get answers to them.

Before You Begin
Optional, but strongly recommended: obtain and install Dia from http://dia-installer.de/Links to an external site.. This program is cross platform and has installers for Windows, Mac, and linux. (If you are running linux, you may also be able to obtain Dia from your distro's repository.)

Dia is a drawing tool with a set of shapes specifically for ER diagrams in the format that we are using for this class. While you can draw your ERD on paper and scan it to PDF, a solution drawn in Dia will obviously look better and be easier to read (and grade!) When you launch Dia, on the left hand side there is a drop-down menu that lets you choose the kinds of shapes you want. Select "ER" to get the shapes specific for ERDs. You may also need to fiddle with the Page Setup dialog to get everything to print (or export) to a single page. Ask for help on Piazza if you can't figure out how to do something with Dia.

Another option is draw.ioLinks to an external site.. It is an online drawing tool that has the shapes needed for this project (look for "Entity Relationship Diagram" in the "Basic" templates; this includes shapes for different notations, please only use the Chen notation shapes used in class). If you happen to have Microsoft Visio, you should be able to do ERDs using the "Chen's Database Notation" template (under "Software"). I'm sure there are many others available.

Project Description
You will be designing a database similar to IMDBLinks to an external site. (only much simpler). For this project, you need to create an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for this database, using the ERD format discussed in class (and described in chapter 3 of your book). You will be provided (below) with a list of data items that will be in the database; your job is to figure out the appropriate entities, attributes, and relationships needed to model the data.

There are many valid models for this data, so I don't expect you to all have the same, "right" answer. (There is no "right" answer; there are, of course, incorrect ways to use the modeling language!) If you think any of your choices are unusual or need explanation, feel free to include a short explanation of your diagram.

The data you need to include is described below:

Data item	Example
Movie title	Star Wars
Movie release year	1977
Movie director(s)	George Lucas
Movie sequel(s)	The Empire Strikes Back is a sequel of Star Wars
Movie star names	Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, etc.
Movie star dates of birth/death	Mark Hamill was born September 25, 1951
Movie star city of residence	Beverly Hills, CA
Movie(s) acted in by star	Mark Hamill acted in Star Wars
Movie reviewer(s), publication(s), or website(s)	Rotten Tomatoes
Movie reviewer/publication/website rating	94%
In addition to the above, think of one additional entity to add to your model and include it (as well its attributes and its relationships with the rest of the model). If you are stuck, try browsing the information available at IMDBLinks to an external site. and see if you can include something from it in your model (but pretty much anything you can think of will do - be creative!).

Grading
Task	Value
Correct usage of the ERD visual language	20 points
Inclusion of all data items in model	20 points
Additional entity of your devising	5 points
Clarity of drawing (how easy it is to read)	5 points
Total:	50 points
Submitting The Project
Submit your ERD in PDF format on Canvas.
